i ended up fixing the positioning of the cards by making a media query of the entire div of the container to static on smaller screens so it doesnt cover up and useful information. That way, it only turns out to be absolute on bigger screens

<!--the naming for the pictures under the popolar courses are named from the first two initials of the words together with numbers starting from the first card to the last, i.e "8"
eg. pcc-1 representing "popular courses card-1">

<span style="font-size:300%;color:yellow;">★</span>
<span style="font-size:500%;color:red;">☆</span>
<span style="font-size:500%;color:blue;">★</span>  -->
